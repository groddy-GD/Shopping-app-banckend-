ðŸ“Œ Project Title:
Shopping App Backend Using Python

ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
To develop a backend-only e-commerce application using Python with functionalities like:

User/Admin login

Product catalog viewing

Cart handling

Simulated payments
All implemented without database or UI â€” using Python dictionaries.

ðŸ’» Technologies Used:
Python

Jupyter Notebook

UUID (for session ID generation)

Dictionaries as Mock Databases

ðŸ§© Features Implemented:
Welcome message display.

Login system for user and admin with session ID.

Mock database using dictionaries:

Users

Admins

Categories

Products

Carts

User Features:

View product catalog

Add to cart

Remove from cart

View cart with total

Checkout with payment method (UPI, Debit Card, etc.)

Admin Features:

Add product

Update product

Delete product

Add category

Delete category

Role-based restrictions: Admin can't access user functions and vice-versa.

ðŸ”„ How It Works:
App displays a welcome screen.

User selects login role (user/admin).

After login, menu shows role-based options.

User manages cart and places orders.

Admin manages catalog and categories.

All actions are printed in the console with confirmations.

âœ… Additional Remarks:
This is a backend simulation project created in Jupyter Notebook without actual database or UI.
It is useful for learning how e-commerce systems work internally â€” including session handling, product management, and checkout flow using core Python.
